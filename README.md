## Project Description

The project looks at the evolution of complaints reported to the police in New York during the last year.
The goal is to analyse the crimes as a function of the district, hour of the day, ethnical background of the victim and the influence of poverty.
**The results can be found in the Jupyter Notebook entitled "PAPER How to stay safe in New York"**


<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions

The questions I want to answer are:
in which district is there the most complaints?
Are there more complaints at night or during the day?
What are the complaints hot points in New York City?
